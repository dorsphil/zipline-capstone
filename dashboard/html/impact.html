        <h2>Operational Impact</h2>
        <p>
            This page highlights the geographic and institutional impact of Zipline's
            delivery operations across Ghana, showing how healthcare facilities
            and communities are supported.

                This chart compares the volume of deliveries received by each facility type including 
                CHPS compounds, health centres, hospitals, and other facilities.
                Approximately 63.4% of all deliveries are directed to CHPS compounds, the most frontline 
                tier of Ghana's health system. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
                This distribution proves Zipline is not just a "hospital supplier" but the primary circulatory
                system for community-based healthcare, sustaining rural facilities that were previously hard to reach.

            This chart displays the distribution of healthcare facility types supported by Zipline Ghana.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The dominance of CHPS compounds and health centres is highly significant. These facilities 
            typically operate at the frontline of primary healthcare, often serving rural communities with 
            limited access to large hospitals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Insight:</b> <br>
            This further affirms our point, as seen in the previous chart, our impact on the frontline, 
            the primary healthcare system.

            This chart illustrates how deliveries for 2023 were distributed across regions in Ghana, 
            showing a number of 5 regions in total.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regional differences in volume are a direct response to healthcare need rather than population size. 
            </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
           The data shows that Zipline's operations are demand-driven, clearly indicating our operational reach
           and the regionsreceiving the most support.

            districts.

            Sefwi Wiawso leads with 22.02% of total deliveries, followed by Aowin (14.44%) and 
            Sefwi Akontombra (9.55%). 
        </p>
        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            This demonstration of Zipline's reach at the community level also shows how dependent most districts 
            are on our services, making our deliveries, not a convenience, but a necessity.
