        <h2>Operational Impact</h2>
        <p>
            This page highlights the geographic and institutional impact of Zipline's
            delivery operations across Ghana, showing how healthcare facilities
            and communities are supported.

            <h3>Reaching the Frontlines: Deliveries by Facility Type</h3>
            <div class="chart-box chart-bar">

            </div>
            <p class="chart-note">
                This chart compares the volume of deliveries received by each facility type.
                Approximately 63.4% of all deliveries are directed to CHPS compounds, the most frontline 
                tier of Ghana's health system. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            By prioritizing CHPS compounds and Health Centres (together accounting for nearly 90% of volume),
            Zipline is effectively bypassing road infrastructure barriers to ensure that rural patients receive 
            the same quality of care as those in urban centers.
            </p>
            <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
                This distribution proves Zipline is not just a "hospital supplier" but the primary circulatory
                system for community-based healthcare, sustaining local clinics that were previously the hardest to reach.

            This chart displays the distribution of healthcare facility types supported by Zipline Ghana,
            including CHPS compounds, health centres, hospitals, and other facilities.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Interpretation:</b> <br>
            The dominance of CHPS compounds and health centres is highly significant. These facilities 
            typically operate at the frontline of primary healthcare, often serving rural or underserved 
            communities with limited access to large hospitals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than concentrating services only in urban or tertiary facilities, the data shows that 
            Zipline's operations are intentionally embedded within the primary healthcare system, where 
            healthcare supply gaps are most likely to disrupt care.
        </p>
        <p><b>Insight:</b> <br>
            This pattern demonstrates that Zipline's value is not limited to high-profile emergency deliveries.
            Instead, it plays a sustained role in strengthening everyday healthcare delivery, ensuring that 
            routine services such as immunization, maternal care, and essential treatments are consistently supported.

        <h3>Geographic Footprint: Regions Served</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-pie">
            <canvas id="regionChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-note">
            This chart illustrates how deliveries are distributed across regions in Ghana, showing that the
            Western North Region is the primary beneficiary with the highest share of 67.9% of total volume.
        </p>

        <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            Regional differences in volume are a direct response to logistical need rather than population size. 
            High percentages in regions like Western North and Ashanti reflect areas where Zipline bypasses 
            severe road infrastructure gaps and "cold chain" deserts. By concentrating flights in these zones,
            the system effectively equalizes healthcare access, ensuring a patient in a remote western district 
            receives the same standard of care as one in a capital city.
            </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
           Rather than evenly distributing deliveries for appearance's sake, the data shows that Zipline's 
           operations are demand-driven and impact-oriented, concentrating resources where rapid medical delivery 
           has the strongest effect on healthcare outcomes.</p>

        <h3>Community Impact: District-Level Beneficiaries</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="districtChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p class="chart-note">
            This horizontal bar chart illustrates the distribution of delivery volumes across various districts,
            highlighting a significant variance in service utilization. Sefwi Wiawso leads with 22.02% of 
            total deliveries, followed by Aowin (14.44%) and Sefwi Akontombra (9.55%), showing a clear concentration 
            of activity in specific geographic clusters.
        </p>
        <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
        The data reveals that a small number of top-performing districts account for a disproportionately large 
        share of deliveries. This high concentration typically identifies "service hotspots"—areas characterized 
        by a high volume of healthcare facilities, limited alternative road-based supply chains, or a greater
        clinical reliance on time-critical medical logistics.
        </p>
        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            This is one of the clearest demonstrations of Zipline's value. The districts most served are likely 
            those where traditional logistics would struggle to deliver consistently, making drone delivery
             not a convenience, but a necessity. In these districts, Zipline effectively acts as an extension 
             of the healthcare system itself, enabling facilities to function reliably despite infrastructure constraints.
