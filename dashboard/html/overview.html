                    This dashboard was designed to move beyond raw delivery counts and instead tell a 
                    coherent story about how Zipline's drone logistics system supports healthcare delivery in Ghana.
                </p>
                <p>Using processed delivery and facility data, the analysis focuses on who is being served, 
                    where they are located, what medical products are delivered, and how quickly those products arrive.
                </p>
                <p>Together, the charts highlight Zipline's role not just as a logistics provider, but as a
                     critical healthcare infrastructure partner, particularly in settings where speed, access, 
                     and reliability directly affect patient outcomes.
