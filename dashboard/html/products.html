    <section class="chart-section">
        <h3>Product Types Delivered</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="productsCategoryChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-note">
            This chart breaks down deliveries by broad medical product categories, revealing that 
            Vaccines (51.6%) and Medical supplies (46.9%) constitute the majority of Zipline's operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prominence of vaccines and essential medical products underscores Zipline's role in supporting
            preventive and routine healthcare. Ensuring people, especially children, in rural sectors have access to 
            quality vaccines and essential medical supplies.
        </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            By ensuring consistent access to routine medical supplies, Zipline helps reduce stockouts, 
            missed vaccinations, and treatment delays; issues that usually affect rural and remote communities.
        </p>

        <h3>Critical Care Demand: Emergency Delivery Breakdown</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">

        <p class="chart-note">
            This chart ranks the specific products requested during emergency flights by volume. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Products such as fluids and blood products dominate emergency deliveries reflecting their critical 
            role in treating severe injuries, childbirth complications, and sudden medical crises.<br/>
            The long tail of smaller-volume emergency products highlights the breadth of emergencies supported, 
            even when individual product demand is low.
        </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            This demonstrates that Zipline's emergency logistics system supports a wide range of 
            life-saving interventions, enabling facilities to 
            respond to diverse and unpredictable medical emergencies with confidence.

        <h3>Operational Tiering: Average Delivery Time by Product Type</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="avgDeliveryTimeChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-note">
            This bar chart compares the average delivery times for various medical categories, 
            showing clear operational tiering based on clinical urgency.

            Medical Supplies at 57.4 minutes and Vaccines at 91.1 minutes.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Faster delivery times for emergency-related products indicate operational prioritization, 
            where time-critical items are dispatched with urgency.
        </p>
    </section>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            The differentiation dynamically balances speed and efficiency based on clinical urgency, aligning logistics 
            with clinical decisions and with patient needs.
