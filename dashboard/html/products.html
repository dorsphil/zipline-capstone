        <h2>Delivered Products & Medical Importance</h2>
        <p>
            This page analyzes the types of medical products delivered by Zipline and their role
            in supporting routine healthcare services and emergency medical response across Ghana.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Product types delivered -->
    <section class="chart-section">
        <h3>Inventory Composition: Product Types Delivered</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="productsCategoryChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-note">
            This chart breaks down deliveries by broad medical product categories, such as vaccines, essential 
            medicines, blood products, and emergency supplies,revealing that Vaccines (51.6%) and
            Medical supplies (46.9%) constitute the overwhelming majority of Zipline's operations.
        </p>
        <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            The prominence of vaccines and essential medical products underscores Zipline's role in supporting
            preventive and routine healthcare, not just emergency response. These deliveries are foundational
            to public health outcomes, particularly for immunization programs and chronic care continuity.
        </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            By ensuring consistent access to routine medical supplies, Zipline helps reduce stockouts, 
            missed vaccinations, and treatment delays; issues that usually affect rural and remote communities.
        </p>

        <h3>Critical Care Demand: Emergency Delivery Breakdown</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="emergencyProductsChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p class="chart-note">
            This horizontal bar chart ranks the specific products requested during emergency flights by volume. 
            Medical Fluids (25.3%) and critical blood products—including Whole Blood (22.2%) and 
            Fresh Frozen Plasma (22.0%) comprising the top three most urgent deliveries
        </p>
        <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            Products such as fluids, blood products, and cardiovascular supplies dominate emergency deliveries,
            reflecting their critical role in trauma care, obstetric emergencies, and acute medical interventions.
            The long tail of smaller-volume emergency products highlights the breadth of emergencies supported, 
            even when individual product demand is low.
        </p>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            This chart demonstrates that Zipline's emergency logistics system is not narrowly specialized. 
            Instead, it supports a wide spectrum of life-saving interventions, enabling facilities to 
            respond to diverse and unpredictable medical emergencies with confidence.

    <!-- Average delivery time -->
    <section class="chart-section">
        <h3>Operational Tiering: Average Delivery Time by Product Type</h3>
        <div class="chart-box chart-bar">
            <canvas id="avgDeliveryTimeChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-note">
            This vertical bar chart compares the average delivery times for various medical categories, 
            demonstrating clear operational tiering based on clinical urgency.
            Blood products lead with the fastest average delivery time of 43.0 minutes, followed by 
            Medical Supplies at 57.4 minutes and Vaccines at 91.1 minutes.
        </p>

        <p> <b>Interpretation:</b><br>
            Faster delivery times for emergency-related products indicate operational prioritization, 
            where time-critical items are dispatched with urgency. More stable delivery times for routine
            products reflect optimized scheduling without compromising reliability.
        </p>
    </section>

        <p><b>Insight:</b><br>
            This differentiation shows operational maturity. Zipline's system does not treat all deliveries 
            equally; it dynamically balances speed and efficiency based on clinical urgency, aligning logistics 
            with clinical decisions with patient needs.
